# Transpolar Arcs
This project contains the code used for my research on transpolar arcs (TPAs), a type of aurora.
The code is used for visualizations of transpolar arc data to identify during which solar wind conditions these aurorae form.

## Required packages
See [environment.yml](environment.yml)

## Data
Note that the code will not run without the data, which has not been uploaded to the Github repo due to size limits.
Future versions of the code might retrieve data via the web, making the code easier to use by anyone. Until then, one can see some example plots generated by the code in [examples.ipynb](examples.ipynb)

## Contributions
All code, except for most of the code in the`test_OMNI` files, is written by Simon Thor. The `test_OMNI` code is mainly written by Lei Cai.
